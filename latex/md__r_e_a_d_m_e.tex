 For too long, video games have been expressed, in Hideo Kojima\textquotesingle{}s words, in the format of "{}sticks,"{} as players confront and compete with each other online. The cultural meaning behind this ever-\/growing industry is something we, as players, must ask ourselves\+: Is this the meaning we are trying to express after all?

Now we live in a world that values separation, isolation, and disconnection more than togetherness and connection.

Inspired by the video game "{}\+Death Stranding,"{} which was released in 2019, the vision for this project aims to revolutionize the RTS genre, transforming its competitive nature into collaboration.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{No man is an island by John Donne}{No man is an island by John Donne}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
No man is an island, ~\newline
 Entire of itself. ~\newline


Each is a piece of the continent, ~\newline
 A part of the main. ~\newline


If a clod be washed away by the sea, ~\newline
 Europe is the less. ~\newline


As well as if a promontory were. ~\newline
 As well as if a manor of thine own ~\newline
 Or of thine friend\textquotesingle{}s were. ~\newline


Each man\textquotesingle{}s death diminishes me, ~\newline
 For I am involved in mankind. ~\newline
 Therefore, send not to know ~\newline


For whom the bell tolls, ~\newline
 It tolls for thee.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{translated to Chinese by 李敖}{translated to Chinese by 李敖}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
有人能自全， 沒有人是孤島，

每人都是大陸的一片， 要為本土應卯

一旦海水沖走， 歐洲就要變小。

那便是一塊土地， 那便是一方海角， 那便是一座莊園， 不論是你的、還是朋友的，

任何人的死亡，都是我的減少， 作為人類的一員，我與生靈共老。

喪鐘在為誰敲，我本茫然不曉， 不為幽明永隔，它正為你哀悼。\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Goal}{Goal}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
